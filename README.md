# nice-java
repo for nice.jar

if you got the jarfile from mediafire, here are the args for the command 
```
nice.jar [int i - how many times this file will google '69' and '420']
```
(hey, if you somehow found this not via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIED_WNkJQM, there is a mediafire link to a jarfile.)
